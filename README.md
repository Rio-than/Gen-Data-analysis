# Lung Cancer Trends & Outcomes Dashboard


Author: Nathan Rotich


  # Overview
This interactive dashboard provides a comprehensive analysis of lung cancer trends and outcomes, focusing on:

Average Survival Years Post-Diagnosis: 5.50 years

Lung Cancer Diagnosis Rate: 4.06%

Early Detection Rate: 28.37%

Gender Distribution: 50.06% male, 49.04% female

# Stage-wise Diagnosis Differences:

Stage 2: -0.73%

Stage 3: -4.37%

Stage 4: +15.55%

Smoking Population Insights:

Higher diagnosis rates among a smaller smoker population compared to non-smokers

Age group 65-70 has the highest number of smokers; 85-90 has the lowest

Treatment Modalities by Gender:

Men: Surgery > Radiotherapy > Chemotherapy

Women: Radiotherapy > Surgery > Chemotherapy

# Geographical Prevalence:

Country with Highest Prevalence: Ethiopia

Region with Highest Prevalence: South Asia

  ## Project Description
The Lung Cancer Trends & Outcomes Dashboard aims to visualize critical metrics and trends in lung cancer diagnosis, treatment, and survival. By leveraging data analytics and visualization tools, the dashboard provides stakeholders with actionable insights to inform policy decisions, research directions, and clinical practices.

  ## Target Audience
This dashboard is designed for:

Healthcare Professionals: To monitor patient outcomes, identify high-risk groups, and tailor treatment strategies.

Clinical Researchers: To analyze trends, evaluate interventions, and identify areas for further study.

Policymakers: To inform public health policies, allocate resources effectively, and implement targeted screening programs.

Public Health Educators: To develop awareness campaigns and educational materials based on current data.

General Public: To increase awareness and understanding of lung cancer trends and risk factors.

  Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

## KPI	Value	Description
Average Survival Years Post-Diagnosis	5.50 years	Indicates the mean survival duration after a lung cancer diagnosis.
Lung Cancer Diagnosis Rate	4.06%	Represents the percentage of the population diagnosed with lung cancer.
Early Detection Rate	28.37%	Percentage of lung cancer cases detected at an early stage.
Gender Distribution	50.06% M / 49.04% F	Shows the proportion of lung cancer cases by gender.
Stage-wise Diagnosis Differences	Stage 2: -0.73%, Stage 3: -4.37%, Stage 4: +15.55%	Highlights the percentage change in diagnoses across different stages.
Smoking Population Insights	Higher diagnosis rates among smokers despite being a smaller population	Emphasizes the impact of smoking on lung cancer prevalence.
Treatment Modalities by Gender	Men: Surgery > Radiotherapy > Chemotherapy; Women: Radiotherapy > Surgery > Chemotherapy	Details preferred treatment methods by gender.
Geographical Prevalence	Ethiopia (Country), South Asia (Region)	Identifies areas with the highest lung cancer prevalence.
